# LocoShapesFinal

# What is this?

This was my first ever mobile app development project I did all the way back in 2016/2017. It was for a university module that I picked and Im happy that I passed this module with 84% overall.

# What was the app?

This was a game called "LocoShapes" made for kids. A user can drag and shop different shapes into a hole to collect points, it uses audio (money ding sound) everytime a user gets it in the right hole.

# Where are the screenshots?

Unfortunately this was done such a long time ago, I didn't know much about development or Github at the time. Since then I have become an iOS developer. I hope to revive this one day but for now, enjoy the Android code way before the Kotlin days!
